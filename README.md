# Music Generation with RNNs

Charles Darwin once said, “If I had my life to live over again, I would have made a rule to read some poetry and listen to some music at least once every week.” As humans, we all like to listen to music to relax, destress, and recreate. Essentially, music consists of a sequence of musical notes.

For this project, I explored building a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for music generation. I trained a model to learn the patterns in raw sheet music in ABC notation and then used this model to generate new music. This project was adapted from the MIT Deep Learning Lab. I utilized Google Colab notebooks for the project.
